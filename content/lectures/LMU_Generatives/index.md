I give this guest lecture as part of ["Deep Learning and AI"](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/cms/studium_lehre/lehre_master/deep1920/index.html) since winter semester 2019, at LMU Munich for master students in computer science and similar majors. 
The major topics of this lecture include
- Introduction to Variational Autoencoders
- Introduction to Generative Adversarial Nets and variants such as CGAN, CycleGAN, etc.
