I give this guest lecture as part of ["Deep Learning and AI"](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/cms/studium_lehre/lehre_master/deep1920/index.html) since winter semester 2021, at LMU Munich for master students in computer science and similar majors. 
The major topics of this lecture include
- Overview of different kinds of uncertainties. 
- Introduction to Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo methods
- Introduction to Variational Inference applied on Bayesian Neural Networks. 

The current lecture slides still involve collaboration with my (former) coworkers and the complete slides will be available in October 2022.
