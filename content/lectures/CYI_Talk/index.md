I had the honor and pleasure to give this [talk](https://www.cyi.ac.cy/index.php/component/k2/seminar-tensorization-and-uncertainty-quantification-in-deep-learning) at the Computation-based Science and Technology Research Center (CASTORC) at Cyprus Institute. The topics include the tensorization trick and uncertainty quantification with scalable GPs. To the first topic there's also a python tutorial [available](https://yinchong-yang.de/post/tensorization/).
