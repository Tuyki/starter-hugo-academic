## Overview

The [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/index.php) collects information about mathematicians in a broader sense such as statisticians, computer scientists, mathematical physicists, etc.. In this database one finds among others their dissertations and academic advisors, which enables tracking down one's academic ancestors throughout history. Sounds exciting doesn't it? However, the project only provides a querying interface via url. So I wrote a simple python script to query, organize and visualize the data.  

## Implementation

1. Performing a tree traversal of pre-order type (or any other type) starting from myself.

This also relies on some regex matches to identify the advisors' urls. I first stored all visited urls in a simple list and download the webpages. 

```python


```
- Iterating through all downloaded webpages, extracting further information of name, advisors, as well as year and country of the dissertations, also using regex. This step generates a table that describes a couple of hundreds of mathematicians with the features above. 
- Starting from the tabular data, one can easily create a graph data structure, where each vertex is a mathematician and the edge is added between him/her and every of his/her advisors. 
- Finally visualize the graph. I used the [igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) package. It is important to apply the [Reingold‚ÄìTilford algorithm](https://www.reingold.co/tidier-drawings.pdf) to calculate the layout, so that the visualized graph has a family-tree kind of favor. 



1. The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site
2. The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**
3. You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more
